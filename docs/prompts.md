I need python script that takes 2 arguments

1. Input Path: The path to a markdown document
2. Output Path: The path to output files

What the script must do open the markdown document given in the Input Path and parse the document and create all the files that are specified in the code blocks.
The Input Document will have the following format:

```
I pasted some bash scripts combined into one Markdown document, that runs as a service that creates an RSS feed of all the files that gets added / updated or deleted from the /var/www/
This happens by parsing logs at /var/log/www_changes.log that looks like this:

```sh
2024-05-27T12:01:25 /var/www/html/lindsey.arc.webally.co.za/src/ app.html MODIFY
2024-05-27T12:01:48 /var/www/html/lindsey.arc.webally.co.za/src/ app.html MODIFY
2024-05-27T12:01:48 /var/www/html/lindsey.arc.webally.co.za/src/ app.html MODIFY

2024-05-27T12:02:07 /var/www/html/lindsey.arc.webally.co.za/src/ app.html MODIFY
```
What I want to do is create an improved feed that displays on a Progressive Web App.
Here is the spec

- Python / Flask for the backend that parses the log file and writes all the logs to a Maria DB database
- All the logs must be classified by project, Look at the logs above, each line looks similar to:
```sh
ai - All AI Driven apps goes here
api - All API's goes here

apps - All Android / IOS Mobile apps goes here
backups - backups for the other folders and should not be monitored
cgi-bin - Standard folder with server setup and should not be monitored
context - App that creates context for AI's
dev - Apps that helps with development goes here
docs - Documentation goes here
ext - Extensions for VSCode and Chrome and others goes here
html - Websites goes here
```
```conf

    ErrorLog /var/www/html/pioneer.webally.co.za/logs/error.log
</VirtualHost>
```
In any one of the project folders there are sub-folders that are all projects, and in any one of those folders there can be a project.json file that will look like this
The project.json file will look like:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "Project Name",
    "path": "/path/to/project", 
    "description": "A brief description of the project",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "Author Name",
    "license": "MIT",
    "repository": {
      "type": "git",
      "url": "https://github.com/username/repo"
    }
  }
}
The project.json file does not need to be there, if there is no such file to get the project data from the project name can be inferred from the folder name.
Here is the workflow the app must follow.`

```
You will notice that in the markdown there are a few code blocks
PLEASE NOTE:
I am gave the above to you in a code block and the code blocks inside that are nested within the code block so the nested code blocks might be escaped but it won't be like that in practice, I to make this clear I am also giving you the same as an upload to the prompt called input.md
---
INSTRUCTIONS:

- The the input document and parse it in the following way
- Find all the code blocks
- Then look for the commented relative path in the first line of the code block, it could be any type of comment
  - #
  - //
  - <!-- {comment} -->
- Create the file in the path specified in the "Output Path by the second argument
- Get the content of the entire code block including the comment in the first line and add it to that file
- If there is no relative path in the first line of the file, then create the file in Output Path in a folder called `__unknown__` and number each file incrementally and give it the extension of .md
Keep on going until the end.
- When a file path is found in the first line that already exist it must create the file with a _{number} at the end of the file name so that all the iterations can be found at the output path
- Please give me all the steps to complete this task give me all the instructions I gave you back to me so that I can be sure you understand the task correctly

This script follows the rules and requirements you specified:

1. It logs all actions taking place to a file (`project_parser.log`) and to the terminal using the `Logger` class.

2. The script is modular, with separate functions for loading settings, saving and loading run history, getting user input, and parsing the markdown file.

3. It adds the relative file path to the first line of each created file as a comment.

4. It adds the version number (`1.0.0`) to each file as the second line.

5. Settings for the app are stored in a `.env` file.

6. If no arguments are supplied, the script provides a list of the last 20 run arguments to choose from. The user can select a previous run by entering the corresponding number or choose to start a new run.

7. If the user chooses a new run, the script prompts for the Input Path and Output Path.

8. After creating all the files, the script generates an `index.md` file in the Output Path by running the `tree` command and writing the results inside a code block.

The script uses the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments, but it also provides an interactive mode when no arguments are supplied.

Please note that this script assumes a Unix-like environment with the `tree` command available. If you're running it on a different platform, you may need to adjust the `tree` command accordingly.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!

---
Create a README.md file and in the README.md answer the following questions as well:

Will the output path be created if it does not exist

In the roadmap discuss how it will work if instead of create numbered files when a file already exists but to create merge request with git. So in other words as soon as a duplicate file is detected a git repo must be added to the output folder if it does not exist yet (GIT will already be installed), all the files must then be committed to the repo with a commit message of "First Commit" the file then instead o creating a numbered file, it must overwrite the document and commit the file again stating the {file name} "To be Merged" or maybe when I open the file in VSCode I will be notified that the file must be still be merged
---

Here's the README.md file with the answers to your questions and the roadmap discussion:

```markdown
# Project Parser

Project Parser is a Python script that parses a markdown file, extracts code blocks, and creates output files based on the specified rules and requirements.

## Features

- Logs all actions taking place to a file and to the terminal
- Modular script design
- Adds the relative file path to the first line of each created file as a comment
- Adds the version number to each file as the second line, starting at 1.0.0
- Stores app settings in a `.env` file
- Provides a list of the last 20 run arguments to choose from if no arguments are supplied
- Prompts for Input Path and Output Path if a new run is selected
- Creates an `index.md` file in the Output Path with the output of the `tree` command

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `project_parser.py` script.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python project_parser.py
```

5. If no arguments are supplied, the script will provide a list of the last 20 run arguments to choose from. Enter the corresponding number to select a previous run or choose to start a new run.
6. If you choose a new run or if no previous runs are available, the script will prompt you for the Input Path and Output Path.
7. The script will parse the markdown file, create output files based on the code blocks, and generate an `index.md` file in the Output Path.

## Questions

### Will the output path be created if it does not exist?

Yes, the script will create the output path if it does not exist. It uses the `os.makedirs()` function with the `exist_ok=True` parameter to create the necessary directories recursively.

## Roadmap

In the future, we plan to enhance the script to handle duplicate files using Git version control instead of creating numbered files. Here's how it will work:

1. When a duplicate file is detected, the script will check if a Git repository exists in the output folder. If it doesn't exist, a new Git repository will be initialized (assuming Git is already installed on the system).

2. All the files in the output folder will be committed to the Git repository with a commit message of "First Commit".

3. Instead of creating a numbered file for the duplicate, the script will overwrite the existing file with the new content.

4. The modified file will be committed to the Git repository with a commit message stating "{file name} - To be Merged".

5. When you open the file in VSCode or any other Git-enabled editor, you will be notified that the file needs to be merged.

This approach allows for better version control and collaborative editing of the output files. It eliminates the need for creating numbered files and promotes a more streamlined workflow using Git.

Please note that this feature is currently in the roadmap and not yet implemented in the script.

Create me a bash script that will make it so that when I type "parsemd" anywhere on rocky linux 9.2 that the script will run from it's own folder that is located at /var/www/tools/AI Response Parser/parsemd.py
---

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. To ensure that the log file and run_history file are created in the script's own folder, you need to modify the script to use absolute paths for those files. Here's the updated script with the necessary changes:

```python
# project_parser.py
# 1.0.0

import os
import json
import argparse
from datetime import datetime

# Constants
SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
LOG_FILE = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, "project_parser.log")
SETTINGS_FILE = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, ".env")
HISTORY_FILE = os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, "run_history.json")
UNKNOWN_FOLDER = "__unknown__"
INDEX_FILE = "index.md"

# Logger class
class Logger:
    def __init__(self, log_file):
        self.log_file = log_file

    def log(self, message):
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        log_entry = f"{timestamp} - {message}"
        print(log_entry)
        with open(self.log_file, "a") as file:
            file.write(log_entry + "\n")

# Load settings from .env file
def load_settings():
    settings = {}
    if os.path.exists(SETTINGS_FILE):
        with open(SETTINGS_FILE, "r") as file:
            for line in file:
                key, value = line.strip().split("=")
                settings[key] = value
    return settings

# Save run history to JSON file
def save_run_history(run_history):
    with open(HISTORY_FILE, "w") as file:
        json.dump(run_history, file, indent=4)

# Load run history from JSON file
def load_run_history():
    if os.path.exists(HISTORY_FILE):
        with open(HISTORY_FILE, "r") as file:
            return json.load(file)
    return []

# Rest of the script code remains the same

# Main function
def main():
    logger = Logger(LOG_FILE)
    settings = load_settings()
    run_history = load_run_history()

    # Rest of the main function code remains the same

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The changes made:

1. Added a new constant `SCRIPT_DIR` to store the absolute path of the script's directory using `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))`.

2. Updated the paths of `LOG_FILE`, `SETTINGS_FILE`, and `HISTORY_FILE` to use `os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, ...)` to create absolute paths relative to the script's directory.

With these modifications, the log file (`project_parser.log`) and the run history file (`run_history.json`) will be created in the same directory as the `parsemd.py` script, regardless of the current working directory.

Make sure to update the `parsemd.py` script with these changes, and it should resolve the issue of the files being created in the output folder instead of the script's own folder.

Give me the entire file again

Here's the entire updated `parsemd.py` script with the changes to create the log file and run history file in the script's own folder:

This script includes the following changes:

1. The script file is named `parsemd.py`.
2. The `SCRIPT_DIR` constant is used to store the absolute path of the script's directory.
3. The `LOG_FILE`, `SETTINGS_FILE`, and `HISTORY_FILE` constants are updated to use absolute paths relative to the script's directory.

With these modifications, the `parsemd.log` file and the `run_history.json` file will be created in the same directory as the `parsemd.py` script, regardless of the current working directory.

Make sure to save this script as `parsemd.py` in the `/var/www/tools/AI Response Parser/` directory on your Rocky Linux 9.2 system. Then, follow the steps provided in the previous response to create the `parsemd` bash script in the `/usr/local/bin` directory, which will allow you to run the `parsemd.py` script from anywhere on your system.
